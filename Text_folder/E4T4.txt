# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Deploy EC2, VPN access policies for example, set up access through cloudfront
# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- yes it is a good idea, creating 1 s3 endpoint in private network will solve the security problem, accesses to s3 will be private and will ensure system security
# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- Default encryption for S3 bucket: Enforce default encryption settings for your S3 bucket. 
  This ensures that all objects stored in the bucket are encrypted by default. 
  However, applying default encryption settings will not encrypt data that already exists in the bucket, data is only encrypted after default encryption has been enabled
# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- When performing the initial deployment template on the system, security or configuration changes will disappear. To keep the configurations unchanged, we need to make changes in the template before deployment.
